👋 Hi, I’m wangbikang

I’m a graduate student at the School of Atmospheric Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, focusing on atmospheric and Earth observation data analysis.

📊 My research interests include remote sensing, satellite data processing, and environmental signal extraction algorithms. I have one published paper:


🔗 **A noise removal algorithm based on adaptive elevation difference thresholding for ICESat-2 photon-counting data**  
Published in *International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation*  
[Read the paper on ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843223000298)
