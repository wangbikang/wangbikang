👋 Hi, I’m wangbikang

I’m a graduate student at the School of Atmospheric Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, focusing on atmospheric and Earth observation data analysis.

📊 My research interests include remote sensing, satellite data processing, and environmental signal extraction algorithms. I have one published paper:

🔗 “A noise removal algorithm based on adaptive elevation difference thresholding for ICESat-2 photon-counting data” — published in International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation on ScienceDirect.
